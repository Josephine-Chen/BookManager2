## 67-272: BookManager 2 ##

This is a lab project for 67-272: Application Design and Development.  The primary objectives of this lab are (1) to teach students how to do basic unit testing using factories rather than fixtures, and (2) to handle date validations in Rails, since there are no built-in validators for dates in the framework.  

In contrast with the first version of BookManager, this project assumes that this is for one publisher (in this case the infamous Acme Publishing, which is the favorite publisher for [Wile E. Coyote](http://decmod.diegoazeta.org/resources/1-Exercises/Acme-Catalog.jpg) and also a producer of great tech books).  In this case, Acme not only wants to track books and authors, but also wants to track books through the various stages of the publishing process: from the initial proposals to signing a contract with author(s) to finally publishing the book.
